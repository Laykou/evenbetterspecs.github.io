# Even Better Specs

Event Better Specs is an opinionated set of best practices to support the creation of tests that are easy to read and maintain.

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:evenbetterspecs/evenbetterspecs.github.io.git
    cd evenbetterspecs 
    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve

## Guiding principles

Our guidelines are based on two fundamental principles:

- tests must be [self-contained](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/the-self-contained-test/), not DRY
- tests should follow the [Arrange-Act-Assert](https://automationpanda.com/2020/07/07/arrange-act-assert-a-pattern-for-writing-good-tests/) pattern
