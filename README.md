# Even Better Specs

Guidelines for readable and maintainable tests.

## Guiding principles

Our guidelines are based on two fundamental principles:

- tests must be [self-contained](https://automationpanda.com/2020/07/07/,arrange-act-assert-a-pattern-for-writing-good-tests/), not DRY
- tests should follow the [Arrange-Act-Assert](https://automationpanda.com/2020/07/07/arrange-act-assert-a-pattern-for-writing-good-tests/) pattern
